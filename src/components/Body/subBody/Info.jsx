            Reprising a collaboration with Jordan Brand that originally dropped
            in 2019, this Air Jordan 6 features a glow-in-the-dark sole and
            perforated underlays with a reflective design—but this time, the
            style arrives framed by shades of British Khaki

            Familiar features include a utilitarian pouch on the ankle—but the
            design now features an additional zip pocket. Cactus Jack branding
            on the lace lock and right heel combines with a smiley face graphic
            on the medial midsole to give the look a playful feel. Infrared
            accents and Nike Air branding on the left heel nod to the OG Air
            Jordan 6, importing a classic feel to La Flame{`'`}s latest Jordan
            Brand creation.
